# dart_code

A package for creating valid and formatted code, e.g. when creating builders.

## Usage





## Inspiration

This package was inspired by the code_builder package.
- It is simpler and likely less complete
- You can extend the code classes to include code build logic
- You can directly use the toString method on the code classes or use the CodeFormatter class for alternative formatting settings.
